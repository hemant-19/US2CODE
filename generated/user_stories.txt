Great! As a Product Owner, I'll focus on delivering value to our potential customers and the business. Here are two Agile user stories for an application to open a bank account, complete with Gherkin acceptance criteria:

---

### User Story 1: Submit Personal Details

**User Story:**
As a potential customer,
I want to securely submit my personal details (e.g., name, address, date of birth, contact details),
so that the bank can identify me and begin processing my new account application.

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

**Scenario: Successful submission of all mandatory personal details**
Given I am on the personal details section of the account application
And all mandatory fields (e.g., Full Name, Date of Birth, Residential Address, Email, Phone Number) are clearly marked
When I enter valid information into all mandatory fields
And I click the "Continue" button
Then I should be navigated to the next step of the application process (e.g., ID verification)
And my entered personal data should be securely stored for processing.

**Scenario: Attempt to submit with missing mandatory fields**
Given I am on the personal details section of the account application
And I have intentionally left a mandatory field (e.g., Residential Address) blank
When I click the "Continue" button
Then I should see an inline error message indicating which fields are missing
And I should remain on the personal details page to correct the errors.

**Scenario: Attempt to submit with invalid data format**
Given I am on the personal details section of the account application
When I enter an invalid date of birth (e.g., a future date)
And I enter an invalid email format (e.g., "myemail.com" without "@")
And I click the "Continue" button
Then I should see specific inline error messages for each invalid field (e.g., "Date of birth cannot be in the future", "Please enter a valid email address")
And I should remain on the personal details page to correct the errors.

### User Story 2: Upload Identity Documents

**User Story:**
As a potential customer,
I want to securely upload copies of my identity documents (e.g., driver's license, passport, utility bill),
so that the bank can verify my identity and comply with KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations.

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

**Scenario: Successful upload of required identity documents**
Given I have completed the personal details section
And I am on the "Upload Identity Documents" step of the application
And the required documents are clearly specified (e.g., Primary ID, Proof of Address)
When I select a valid primary ID document file (e.g., passport.jpg)
And I select a valid proof of address document file (e.g., utility_bill.pdf)
And I click the "Upload & Continue" button
Then I should see a confirmation message that my documents have been uploaded successfully
And I should be navigated to the next application step (e.g., review and submit)
And the uploaded documents should be securely stored for internal review by bank staff.

**Scenario: Attempt to upload an unsupported file type**
Given I am on the "Upload Identity Documents" step of the application
And the accepted file types are clearly stated (e.g., JPG, PNG, PDF)
When I attempt to upload a file with an unsupported format (e.g., identity.docx)
Then I should see an error message indicating the file type is not allowed
And the file should not be uploaded.

**Scenario: Attempt to upload a file exceeding the size limit**
Given I am on the "Upload Identity Documents" step of the application
And the maximum file size limit is 5MB per document
When I attempt to upload a document that is 6MB (e.g., oversized_passport.jpg)
Then I should see an error message indicating the file exceeds the maximum size
And the file should not be uploaded.
