Great! As a Product Owner for a hospital patient registration application, here are two Agile user stories with Gherkin acceptance criteria. I'll focus on core functionalities for a new patient.

### User Story 1: Register New Patient - Core Demographics

**User Story:**
As a **Hospital Registrar**,
I want to **register a new patient with their essential demographic and contact information**,
so that **their basic profile is securely recorded for initial care planning and hospital administration.**

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

**Scenario: Successful New Patient Registration**
*Given* I am on the "New Patient Registration" screen
*And* I have entered all required patient details:
    *   "First Name" as "John"
    *   "Last Name" as "Doe"
    *   "Date of Birth" as "1990-05-15"
    *   "Gender" as "Male"
    *   "Phone Number" as "555-123-4567"
    *   "Address Line 1" as "123 Main St"
    *   "City" as "Anytown"
    *   "State" as "NY"
    *   "Zip Code" as "12345"
    *   "Admission Date" as "2023-10-26"
    *   "Chief Complaint" as "Fever and cough"
*When* I click the "Register Patient" button
*Then* A unique "Patient ID" should be generated (e.g., "P-2023-0001")
*And* The patient's full demographic and admission information should be saved to the system
*And* I should see a confirmation message "Patient John Doe registered successfully with ID P-2023-0001"
*And* The form fields should clear, ready for the next patient registration.

**Scenario: Attempt to Register Patient with Missing Required Information**
*Given* I am on the "New Patient Registration" screen
*And* I have entered some, but not all, required patient details (e.g., "First Name", "Last Name", "Phone Number")
*And* I have intentionally left a required field blank (e.g., "Date of Birth")
*When* I click the "Register Patient" button
*Then* An error message "Date of Birth is required" should be displayed next to the missing field
*And* The patient should not be registered in the system
*And* All previously entered information should remain in the form fields.

### User Story 2: Add Patient Emergency Contact

**User Story:**
As a **Hospital Registrar**,
I want to **record emergency contact information for a registered patient**,
so that **the hospital can quickly reach designated individuals in case of an emergency or for important updates.**

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

**Scenario: Successfully Adding a Single Emergency Contact**
*Given* I have successfully registered a patient with "Patient ID P-2023-0001"
*And* I am on the patient's "Emergency Contact" section of their profile
*When* I enter the following emergency contact details:
    *   "Contact Name" as "Jane Doe"
    *   "Relationship" as "Spouse"
    *   "Phone Number" as "555-987-6543"
    *   "Email Address" as "jane.doe@example.com" (optional field)
*And* I click the "Add Contact" button
*Then* The emergency contact "Jane Doe" should be saved and associated with "Patient ID P-2023-0001"
*And* I should see a confirmation message "Emergency contact for John Doe (P-2023-0001) added successfully."
*And* The new contact should be displayed in a list of emergency contacts for that patient.

**Scenario: Attempt to Add Emergency Contact with Missing Required Information**
*Given* I have successfully registered a patient with "Patient ID P-2023-0001"
*And* I am on the patient's "Emergency Contact" section of their profile
*When* I attempt to add an emergency contact by entering only "Contact Name" as "Jane Doe"
*And* I intentionally leave "Relationship" and "Phone Number" blank (required fields)
*And* I click the "Add Contact" button
*Then* An error message "Relationship is required" should be displayed
*And* An error message "Phone Number is required" should be displayed
*And* The emergency contact should not be saved
*And* The entered "Contact Name" ("Jane Doe") should remain in its field.
